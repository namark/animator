# animator
I just wanted to draw some animations. This is a very old project that I revisit form time to time. Lots of wheel reinvention, duplication, ugly code and near undefined behaviors. 

### Building

Should work fine with both Qt 4 and 5. You'll find some additional .ims files in "release" section, that you'll need to copy to the execution directory of the application since it relies on those.

### Usage

Somewhat described [here](http://progenthu.com/index.php?p=animator).
